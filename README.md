## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python (3.8 or newer)
- Node.js and npm

### 1. Running the Backend (FastAPI Server)

1.  **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate on macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will now be running at `http://localhost:8000`. Leave this terminal open.

### 2. Running the Frontend (React App)

1.  **Open a New Terminal** at the project's root directory.

2.  **Serve the Frontend:**
    *The simplest way is to use `npx serve`.*
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The command will output a URL, typically `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by the `serve` command (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
